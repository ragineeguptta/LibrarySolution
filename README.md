# Book Library API â€” .NET + MS SQL

## Goal: 
### Build a secure, well-structured Web API that manages Books, Authors, Borrowers (users) and Issue / Return functionality, with JWT security, validations, EF Core migrations, Swagger, and tests. This guide is tailored for Windows 11 and uses the dotnet CLI and a single Web API project structure (easy to follow).
